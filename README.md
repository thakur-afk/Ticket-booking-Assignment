## ðŸ§  Booking Logic

1. A user can request 1 to 7 seats.
2. The backend first looks for **available seats in the same row**.
3. If not possible, it calculates all **combinations** of available seats and picks the group with the **lowest total pairwise distance** (closest proximity).
4. Once booked, those seats are marked as `isBooked: true`.
